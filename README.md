The Bandra–Worli Sea Link (officially known as Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link).
It is a cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts on either side that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai.
The bridge is a part of the proposed Western Freeway that will link the Western Suburbs to Nariman Point in Mumbai's main business district.
The ₹19.75 billion (US$290 million) bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).
It is built by the Hindustan Construction Company. 
The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge were opened to the public on 30 June 2009.
All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010.
The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak hours from 20–30 minutes to 10 minutes.
As of October 2009, BWSL had an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles.
Its is open by Sonia Gandhi.
